CrystFEL
========

This is a personal **unofficial** repository of CrystFEL for processing serial crystallography dataset.
The official CrystFEL website is http://www.desy.de/~twhite/crystfel/ and the repository is  http://git.bitwiz.org.uk/?p=crystfel.git.

Warning!
--------

I am testing various ideas on this repository. 
Some are not stable yet and **NOT** recommended for publication work. 
Use at your own risk!
