 * The field <structfield>data</structfield> contains the raw image data, if it
 * is currently available.  The data might be available throughout the
 * processing of an experimental pattern, but it might not be available when
 * simulating, scaling or merging patterns.  Similarly,
 * <structfield>flags</structfield> contains an array of the same dimensions
 * as <structfield>data</structfield> to contain the bad pixel flags.
 * <structfield>twotheta</structfield> likewise contains an array of 2*theta
 * (scattering angle) values in radians, since these values are generated as a
 * by-product of the scattering vector calculation and can be used later for
 * calculating intensities from differential scattering cross sections.
 *
 * <structfield>crystals</structfield> is an array of %Crystal directly
 * returned by the low-level indexing system. <structfield>n_crystals</structfield>
 * is the number of crystals which were found in the image.
 *
 * <structfield>copyme</structfield> represents a list of HDF5 fields to copy
 * to the output stream.
